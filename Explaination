The code consists of several functions:

drawBoard() - This function displays the current state of the game board.
isMoveValid(int row, int col) - This function checks if a move is valid by ensuring that the specified cell is within the bounds of the board and is not already occupied.
checkForWin() - This function checks if any player has won the game by examining each row, column, and diagonal for three consecutive marks.
switchPlayer() - This function switches the current player after each move.
makeMove() - This function gets the move (row and column) from the current player, checks its validity, and updates the board accordingly.
main() - This is the main function that initializes the board, draws it, and continues the game loop until a win condition is met.
